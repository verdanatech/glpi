## Support
GLPI is a living software. Improvements are continuously made, new functionalities are being developed, and issues are being fixed.

To ease support and development, we need your help when encountering issues.
There is a GLPI version typical lifecycle:
 * A new major version (9.3) is released.
 * Minor versions (9.3.x), fixing bugs or issues, are published after several weeks.
   Please consider updating to the latest released minor version if you encounter some bugs or performance issues.
 * Several months after major version released, a new major version (9.4) is released.
   Previous major versions become unsupported, please update to the new major version.
   Obviously, we provide support for the migration tools too!
